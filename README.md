Repository of sample code for the corresponding [blog post](https://spatial-focus.net/blog/bringing-net-extensions-to-xamarin-forms)

With the rise and evolution of ASP.NET Core a lot of practical libraries were created and bundled as `.NET Extensions`. In the official [.NET Extensions Github repository](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions) (hint: select a corresponding release branch if you want to check it out) it is described as follows:

>.NET Extensions is an open-source, cross-platform set of APIs for commonly used programming patterns and utilities, such as dependency injection, logging, and app configuration. Most of the API in this project is meant to work on many .NET platforms, such as .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and others.

This blog posts will focus on the integration of .NET extensions into Xamarin.Forms.
